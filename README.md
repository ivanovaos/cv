Hello guest!

You reached a personal page of Olga Ivanova (me), born in Russia and currently live in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I got my bachelor degree in computer science in Russia but after several years of working as a java developer I decided to change my carrier path quite drastically and left Russia pursuing a new path - Bioinformatics. I finished my master in bioinformatics in Amsterdam at Vrije Universiteit. For pure CS layman it was not an easy path but I was ready to do everything to make it work. And it indeed worked! I fall in love with Amsterdam and the Netherlands, so I am still here eating poffertjes and herrings, hunting for sun during all seasons, fighting with wind and appreciating nice people and cosy places. Now bioinformatics is a big part of my life, my profession and my passion. I work as a bioinformatician/systems biologist at Academisch Medisch Centrum in Amsterdam and as a junior teacher at Vrije Universiteit. The topics I find exciting are ageing, bioinformatics algorithms, genome editing (CRISPR/CAS9), AI and ML. My current research projects touch upon genetic interactions (or epistasis), asthma, modeling genetic networks and drugs in them with logical models and Petri nets, data analysis and data integration. I don't have any publications yet, but I hope it will change quite soon. I am now co-organizing two communities in Amsterdam: SbS@UvA Friday club and R-Ladies.

If you work in science, science is your profession and hobby at the same time because there is rarely time for other hobbies. But in the spare moments I do love reading, travelling, swimming, walking, socializing, studying languagues, listening music, among other things - nothing special here. I wish I have more time for my hobbies, and I find it difficult to cope with the idea that we have just one life and only 24 hours per day.
