Hello! 

This is my personal page. I am Olga Ivanova, I was born in Russia and currently live in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Bioinformatics is a big part of my life. I work as a bioinformatician at Academisch Medisch Centrum in Amsterdam and as a junior teacher at Vrije Universiteit. The topics I find exciting: ageing, bioinformatics algorithms and genome editing (CRISPR/CAS9).
